## Introduction
This project aims to demonstrate simple ciphers, such as the Vernam Cipher and Caesar Cipher using basic logic gates and flip-flops on the Nexys A7 FPGA board. Each cipher enabling users to input letters in binary code and observe the resulting ciphertext generated by the encryption process.

## Theoretical description and explanation

This project aims to demonstrate simple ciphers, in this case the Vernam Cipher and Caesar Cipher using basic logic gates and flip-flops on the Nexys A7 FPGA board. Each cipher enabling users to input letters in binary code and observe the resulting ciphertext generated by the encryption process. Buttons and switches serve as input devices for users to input plaintext messages and control the encryption/decryption process. The seven-segment display is used to show the binary code that we want to encode/decode and this encoded or decoded code can be seen in the Putty console on PC.

## Software description

### High level overview

<img src=""/>

This diagram illustrates the components used and the important data flows between them. The components are instantiated in the [top_level](https://github.com/Karelabiss/VHDL_DE1_FEKT_Cipher/blob/main/Project_final/top_level.vhd).

### Component: Caesar Siphre <sup>[source](), [testbench]() </sup>

<img src="https://github.com/Karelabiss/VHDL_DE1_FEKT_Cipher/blob/main/img/Ceaser_tb_image.png"/>

The `input` is given as "ahoj" (65 - a, 72 - h, 79 - o, 74 - j), the `shift` is set to 2, so when encoding, 2 is added to each letter and output as `code_output` (encoded message). Subsequently, `code_output` is transformed into `coded_text_input`, and the `shift` is subtracted from its values to produce `decode_output`, which is essentially the decoded output.

### Component: hex-binary converter and splitter <sup>[source](), [testbench]() </sup>

This component converts hexadecimal numbers supplied by the previous component to a binary number. Afterwards, the binary number is split into signals of
`hundreds`, `tens` and `ones`, which can be easily displayed as numbers on 7-segment displays.

Simulation example with input numbers 51, 30, 124, 2901. The algorithm splits them into four signals,
each standing for one digit, e.g. 2901 → 2;9;0;1. Note that our sensor supports at most 400 cm, making
the signal for thousands redundant.

### Component: 7-segment diplay driver <sup>[source](), [testbench]()</sup>

<img src="">

This component acts as a driver for the displays: it maps binary numbers to individual segments. The component has several inputs, including `hundreds`, `tens` and `ones`.
It uses a counter to cycle through these vector signals to select which one to display on each 7-segment display.

## Instructions

Connecting the board to the computer using the 6Pin USB TTL UART converter.
